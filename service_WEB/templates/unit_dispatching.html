                <p class="lead">During the IBM Call for Code hackathon at UC Berkeley, we decided to build a dispatcher 
                working in real-time including a lot of different information from the ground and from external platforms as weather

                        <p class="lead"> The dispatching at AsTeR is build with Djikstra algorithms providing the faster trajectories from
                        the current location of the unit to the destination. The trajectories can be update in real time if the unit want it 
                        or of new information appear in our database.
                        <p class="lead"> The units are sharing their location in real time, which will give us a way to manage the different
                        units on a specific area. After natural disasters, the efficiency of emergency services is possible if everyone have 
                        the right information. AsTeR provide a convenient solution to manage a lot of units in the time during crisis.
